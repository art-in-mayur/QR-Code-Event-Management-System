The QR Code Event Management System streamlines event registration, check-in, and check-out processes using QR codes. By utilizing QR codes, event organizers can enhance attendee experience, efficiently manage entry, and gather valuable insights into event participation.

## Features

- **QR Code Generation**: Generate unique QR codes for registered attendees, containing their registration details.

- **Database Integration**: Seamlessly connect to a SQLite database to store attendee information, including names, contact details, and QR code data.

- **Real-time Check-in**: Scan attendee QR codes during the event to instantly check them in and record their entry time.

- **Attendance Tracking**: Keep track of attendees' check-in and check-out times to monitor event participation.

- **Intuitive Interface**: Enjoy a user-friendly interface that displays real-time feedback on QR code scanning and attendance status.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**:
   - Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
   - Install required libraries using the following command:
     ```
     pip install opencv-python pyzbar
     ```

2. **Database Setup**:
   - Create a SQLite database named `attendees.db` in the project directory to store attendee information.

3. **Running the Program**:
   - Run the program by executing the `main.py` file:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```
   - The program will initiate the webcam feed and start scanning QR codes.

## Usage

1. **Registration**:
   - Organizers can register attendees and generate unique QR codes containing their details.

2. **Event Check-in**:

3. **Event Check-out**:
   - If desired, organizers can enhance the system to support attendee check-out.

4. **Real-time Feedback**:
   - Attendees receive real-time feedback on their QR code scans, indicating successful check-in or other relevant information.
